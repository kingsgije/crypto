# My Crypto Thoughts

The crypto landscape has certainly changed recently, and below are a few of my thoughts/recommendations:

* [Browser](#brave-browser) - Earn cypto (BAT) while **privately** browsing
* [CeFi](#centralized-finance-cefi) - Earn Passive Income
* [DeFi Savings](#defi-saving-account) - Earn Passive Income

## Privacy Browser

* **Brave**

  * **Quick Thought:** Use [Brave](https://brave.com) to browse privately and search privately, while earning Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) crypto
  * Recommendations for earning BAT:
    * Verify Brave Private Ads is "Enabled" and set to max of "10 ads per hour"
    * Verify Auto-Contribute is "OFF"
    * Link your "Brave Rewards" to [Gemini](<https://gemini.com/share/av7qr7fd>)
      * Personally I do NOT recommend linking rewards to Uphold
      * Monthly, your rewards will be transferred to your linked account
      * Gemini allows you to move your crypto to interest account called Earn
  * Recommendations for privacy
    * Set search engine to "Brave"

## Centralized Finance (CeFi)

* **Celsius**
  * **Quick Thought:** Personal favorite, as still offers interest on new deposits
    * Offers direct deposit from Bank (ACH) for a fee
      * Recommend transferring crypto from another wallet or exchange
    * Does offer ability to swap crypto for zero fees
    * Stablecoins (like GUSD) currently earning 7.10% interest rate
      * Stablecoin is crypto that is always equal to $1
    * Interest is paid in kind
    * Interest payments are weekly (Monday)
    * In the USA, you can ***NOT*** earn CEL native token
  * **Tip:** Deposit funds from bank into Gemini Exchange (automatically converts to GUSD). After 5 days transfer GUSD to Celsius.
  * **Tip2:** Celsius often offers promo codes <https://celsius.network/promotion-rules>
  * **Friendly Security Advice:** Please setup 2FA on your account!

* **BlockFi**
  * **Quick Thought:** No longer offers interest bearing accounts for new deposits :(
    * Allows for direct deposit from Bank (ACH)
  * **Tip:** Sign up for **BlockFi Credit Card** that pays 1.5% cashback in Bitcoin (BTC)
  * **Friendly Security Advice:** Please setup 2FA on your account!

## DeFi Saving Account

* **Donut App**
  * **Quick Thought:** Good option for getting decent yield without investing in cryto (as they do it for you)
    * Provides 3 options:
      * Save: 4% Fixed
      * Build: 5-7% (requires $2,500 deposit)
      * Grow: 8-10% (requires $5,000 deposit)
    * Interest is paid continuous
